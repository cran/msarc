Description: The output of an affinity-purification mass spectrometry
 experiment is typically a list of proteins that were observed
 in the experiment, identified by UniProt identifiers
 (http://www.uniprot.org/).  This package takes as input a list of
 UniProt identifiers, and the associated Mascot scores from the
 experiment (which indicate the likelihood that the protein has
 been correctly identified), clusters them by gene ontology
 category (http://geneontology.org/), then draws diagrams
 showing the results in hierarchical clusters by category, with lines
 for individual proteins representing the associated Mascot score.
 The results are in general not publication-ready, but will rather
 require editing via a graphics editor that can interpret SVG (scalable
 vector graphics) format.  As an alternative representation, the
 package will also generate tag clouds based on the Mascot scores.
